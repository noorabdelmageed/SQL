# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
(
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)
;

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. Determine the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY
artist_name,
track_name
;

#2. Display the Top 10 songs and corresponding artists ordered by popularity.
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#3. What is the average danceability for the Top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
popularity,
AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#4. What is the most danceable song?
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE
    danceability IN
    (
    SELECT MAX(danceability)
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    )
;

#5. What is the longest song? What is the shortest song?
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE
    duration_ms IN
    (
    SELECT MAX(duration_ms)
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    )
    OR
    duration_ms IN 
    (
    SELECT MIN(duration_ms)
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    )
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
;

#6.Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS
    (
    SELECT
    s.artist_name,
    AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
    FROM Spotifydata s
    GROUP BY s.artist_name
    )
SELECT 
artist_name,
average_popularity,
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90
;
